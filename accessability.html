            <h2 id="rules-followed">Mesures we took to make our website accessible</h2>
            <p> What we did to achieve this was first make the page scalable on multiple device sizes. This was a hard job that in our opinion we didnt do as well as we should have, becasue we spent too much time focusing on the bigger screen sizes. We made sure that the website look good on the mobile size but we could have worked on other sizes as well.The other thing we did to make it scale easier is use procentages where it was possible because they are better to scale than pixels. The other thing that we did was make the colors have good contrast for better visibility. </p>
            <p>We also focused on having a simple website where everything that should be in focus is brightly colored. We choose to make most of the content pretty big and visible just to ensure that someone with weaker sight will be able to see. </p>
            <p>We also choose to focus on good navigation choices. We made a very visible nav on top of the page to allow the user to see the next possible option all the time. The nav also has dropdown menus to take the reader to different parts of the next if they don’t want to look through the whole text and look for a certain section. The buttons in the navigation bar also have a hoover function just for the added feedback to the user so that they are certain to where they are. </p>
            <img src="media/example1.png" alt="Picture of the index page as an example of bright and big" title="Example where we focused on visibiilty">
            <p>We also made sure to include descriptive alternative text under all images so when the text is read with a reading tool it will help those who cannot see the pictures but allow them to understand what that picture is. </p>
            <p>We broke the text into smaller readable paragraphs all with relevant headings and titles, so the user doesn’t have to read through big chunks of text. We did this to make sure that the text is readable and understandable. </p>
            <img src="media/example2.png" alt="image of an example of big text">
            <p>All the links we made sure to keep in their distinctive blue and purple color so that the user is certain to be able to tell what the link Is and where it leads to so that they don’t have to doubt on clicking on the wrong thing. We also added a hoover effect over the links in the source on the technology and accessibility page. </p>
            <img src="media/example3.png" alt="a screenshot of how the links look">
            <h2>Lighthouse test</h2>
            <p>We a ran the lighthouse automated accessibility test and made changes according to it. </p>
