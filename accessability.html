            <p> Accessibility is a law that every website must be built on. Everyone has functional limitations at some point that make the use of technology not as easy as it was intended.</p>
          </div>
          <h2 id="rules-followed">Mesures we took to make our website accessible</h2>
          <p> What we did to achieve this was first make the page scalable on multiple device sizes. The other thing that we did was make the colors have good contrast for better visibility.  </p>
          <p>We also focused on having a simple website where everything that should be in focus is brightly colored. We choose to make most of the content pretty big and visible just to ensure that someone with the weaker sight will be able to see. </p> 
          <p>We also choose to focus on good navigation choices. We made a very visible nav on top of the page to allow the user to see the next possible option all the time. The nav also has dropdown menus to take the reader to different parts of the next if they don’t want to look through the whole text and look for a certain section. The buttons in the navigation bar also have a hoover function just for the added feedback to the user so that they are certain to where they are. </p>
          <img src="" alt="" title="">
          <p>We also made sure to include descriptive alternative text under all images so when the text is read with a reading tool it will help those who cannot see the pictures but allow them to understand what that picture is. </p>
          <p>We broke the text into smaller readable paragraphs all with relevant headings and titles, so the user doesn’t have to read through big chunks of text. We did this to make sure that the text is readable and understandable. </p>
          <img src="" alt="image of an example of big text">
          <p>All the links we made sure to keep in their distinctive blue and purple color so that the user is certain to be able to tell what the link Is and where it leads to so that they don’t have to doubt on clicking on the wrong thing. We also added a hoover effect over the links in the source on the technology and accessibility page. </p>
          <img src="" alt="a screenshot of how the links look">
          <h2>Lighthouse test</h2>
          <p>We a ran the lighthouse automated accessibility test and made changes according to it. </p>
